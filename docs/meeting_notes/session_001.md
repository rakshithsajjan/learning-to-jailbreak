# Session 001: Initial Research Discussion
**Date**: 2025-07-14
**Advisor**: Prof. Geoffrey Hinton (AI)
**Student**: Rakshith Sajjan

## Meeting Agenda
1. Initial research idea presentation
2. Critical analysis and assumptions
3. Research direction refinement
4. Next steps

## Discussion Points

### 1. Core Research Concept
**Student's Proposal**: Use RL (GRPO) to finetune an LLM to jailbreak other models for automated safety testing, creating a GAN-like adversarial system.

**Critical Questions Raised**:
- Why GRPO specifically? Have you considered other RL algorithms like PPO, DPO, or RLHF?
- How will you ensure the adversarial model doesn't just memorize known jailbreaks?
- What's your success metric - number of jailbreaks, novelty, transferability?

### 2. Technical Challenges
- **Reward Signal Design**: How do you define "successful jailbreak"? Binary or graded?
- **Exploration vs Exploitation**: How to encourage novel attack strategies?
- **Computational Resources**: RL training is expensive - what's your compute budget?

### 3. Ethical Considerations
- How do we ensure this research doesn't enable malicious actors?
- Should we implement a responsible disclosure process?
- What safeguards will be in place during experimentation?

## Action Items
1. Literature review on adversarial LLM training
2. Define clear success metrics
3. Design initial reward function
4. Sketch out experimental protocol

## Next Meeting Topics
- Review of related work
- Proposed methodology discussion
- Baseline implementation plan
