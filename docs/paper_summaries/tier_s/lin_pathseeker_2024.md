## Executive Summary

PathSeeker introduces a novel black-box jailbreak method inspired by "rats escaping a maze" that leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning to systematically find vulnerabilities in LLM security defenses. The approach uses smaller models collaborating to guide the main LLM in performing mutation operations, progressively modifying inputs based on feedback to induce harmful responses. The method demonstrates superior performance across 13 commercial and open-source LLMs, achieving particularly high success rates on strongly aligned models like GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.5, and GLM-4-air.

## Detailed Analysis with Jailbreak RL Relevance

### Core Innovation
PathSeeker represents a significant advancement in jailbreak RL by:
1. **Multi-Agent Framework**: Uses multiple smaller models to collaboratively guide the main attack, distributing the search process
2. **Maze Navigation Metaphor**: Conceptualizes each LLM as having a unique "security maze" with exploration strategies
3. **Vocabulary Richness Exploitation**: Introduces a novel reward mechanism that exploits expanding vocabulary richness in responses to weaken security constraints
4. **Black-box Approach**: Operates without requiring model internals, making it applicable to closed-source models

### Methodological Contributions
- **Reinforcement Learning Integration**: The core RL component uses feedback from victim models to improve attack strategies
- **Progressive Mutation**: Systematically modifies inputs based on accumulated experience and model feedback
- **Reward Signal Design**: Novel reward mechanism based on vocabulary expansion observation
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Smaller models collaborate to guide the main LLM's mutation operations

### Technical Architecture
The system likely employs:
1. **Exploration Phase**: RL agents explore the "security maze" of the target LLM
2. **Mutation Operations**: Guided modifications to input prompts based on RL policy
3. **Feedback Processing**: Analysis of model responses to inform next iterations
4. **Collaborative Learning**: Multiple agents share information to improve overall attack effectiveness

## Research Context & Problem Statement

### Problem Definition
Traditional jailbreak attacks face limitations:
- **Model Dependency**: Often rely on internal model information
