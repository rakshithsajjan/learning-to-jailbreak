**Published:** January 28, 2025  
**Classification:** Tier S (Essential - Novel RL approach with representation guidance)

## Executive Summary

xJailbreak introduces a groundbreaking RL-based jailbreaking method that leverages representation space guidance to optimize prompt generation. By analyzing embedding proximity between benign and malicious prompts, the method ensures rewritten prompts maintain original intent while moving from malicious to benign representation spaces. The approach achieves SOTA performance on multiple models including Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (80% ASR), Llama3.1-8B-Instruct (63% ASR), and GPT-4o-0806 (75% ASR), while introducing interpretability through visualization of attack trajectories in embedding space.

## Detailed Analysis with Jailbreak RL Relevance

### Core Innovation
xJailbreak's key insight is that malicious and benign prompts occupy distinct regions in representation space. By guiding RL optimization to move malicious prompts toward benign regions while preserving intent, the method creates more interpretable and effective attacks. This represents a significant advance over heuristic methods that lack theoretical grounding.

**Critical for Your Project:** This paper provides the most sophisticated RL framework for jailbreaking yet developed, with clear theoretical foundations and practical implementation details. The representation guidance approach offers a principled way to design reward functions beyond simple success/failure signals.

### Architecture Components

1. **PPO Agent**: Selects rewriting templates based on current prompt embeddings
2. **HelperLLM**: Llama3-8B-Instruct-Jailbroken for executing rewriting commands
3. **VictimLLM**: Target model being attacked
4. **Embedding Model**: Llama3-8B-Instruct-Jailbroken for representation analysis
5. **Judge Models**: LLM-based evaluation for validity and intent preservation

**Implementation Insight:** The use of embeddings as state representation is crucial - it allows the RL agent to perceive the semantic position of prompts and make informed decisions about rewriting strategies.

## Research Context & Problem Statement

### Problem Definition
Existing jailbreak methods suffer from:

2. **Weak reward signals**: Binary success/failure insufficient for learning
3. **Intent drift**: Rewritten prompts often lose original meaning
4. **Evaluation inadequacy**: Current metrics don't ensure semantic consistency

### Hypothesis
RL can be made more effective and interpretable by:
1. Using representation space to guide optimization
2. Incorporating intent preservation in reward function
3. Providing dense feedback through embedding analysis
4. Enabling visualization of attack strategies

### Validation Approach
Comprehensive evaluation against GPTFuzz, Cipher, and RL-JACK across multiple models with triple-metric assessment (Rule, Validity, Intent).

## Methodology Analysis

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **State Representation**: Embed current prompt using Llama3-8B-Instruct-Jailbroken
2. **Action Selection**: PPO agent selects rewriting template based on embedding
3. **Prompt Rewriting**: HelperLLM executes selected template
4. **Embedding Update**: Compute embedding of rewritten prompt
5. **Borderline Score**: Calculate position relative to benign/malicious centers
6. **Attack Execution**: Send rewritten prompt to VictimLLM
7. **Response Evaluation**: Assess validity and intent preservation
8. **Reward Calculation**: Combine borderline and intent scores
9. **Policy Update**: Update PPO policy based on reward

### Key Algorithmic Innovations

**Borderline Score Calculation:**
- **Centers**: Compute centroids of malicious (H) and benign (B) prompt embeddings
- **Midpoint**: M = (H + B) / 2
- **Transfer Vector**: V_c = B - H (direction from malicious to benign)
- **Position Vector**: V_n = N - M (new prompt relative to midpoint)
- **Projection**: V_p = projection of V_n onto V_c
- **Score**: d̄ = ||V_p|| / ||V_c|| with logarithmic compression

**Intent Score Evaluation:**
- **Scale**: -1 (unrelated), 0 (somewhat related), 1 (very similar)
- **Evaluation**: LLM-based comparison of original vs. rewritten prompt
- **Threshold**: Only award positive rewards for "very similar" (score=1)
