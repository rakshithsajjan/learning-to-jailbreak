## Executive Summary

PAIR (Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement) introduces a groundbreaking algorithm for generating semantic jailbreaks with black-box access to LLMs, requiring only 20 queries on average. Inspired by social engineering attacks, PAIR uses an attacker LLM to iteratively refine jailbreak attempts against a target LLM, achieving competitive success rates and transferability across open and closed-source models including GPT-3.5/4, Vicuna, and Gemini. This represents a paradigm shift from static jailbreak templates to dynamic, adaptive attack generation.

## Detailed Analysis with Jailbreak RL Relevance

1. **Attacker LLM**: Generates and refines jailbreak attempts
2. **Target LLM**: Provides responses that guide refinement
3. **Iterative Loop**: Systematic improvement based on feedback
4. **Semantic Consistency**: Maintains attack meaningfulness

### Jailbreak RL Integration Potential
