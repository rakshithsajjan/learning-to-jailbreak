### Paper: Universal and Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Aligned Language Models
**Authors**: Zou et al.
**Year**: 2023
**Venue**: arXiv

**Summary**:
Introduces GCG (Greedy Coordinate Gradient) method for generating adversarial suffixes that cause aligned LLMs to produce harmful content. Shows these attacks transfer across models.

**Key Contributions**:
1. Automated method for finding universal jailbreak suffixes
2. Demonstration of transferability across model families
3. Analysis of why safety training fails

**Methodology**:
- Gradient-based optimization of adversarial suffixes
- Multi-model training for transferability
- Discrete token optimization

**Results**:
- High success rates on GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude, Llama
- Transferable attacks work ~80% of time
- Found patterns in successful attacks

**Limitations**:
- Suffixes often look unnatural/garbled
- Computationally expensive
- May be easily detectable

**Relevance to Our Work**:
- Strong baseline to compare against
- Shows feasibility of automated jailbreaking
- Transferability is key insight

**Ideas to Build Upon**:
- Can RL find more natural-looking attacks?
- Multi-turn conversations vs single suffixes
- Combine with semantic understanding

**Critical Questions**:
- Why do these transfers work across different architectures?
- Could RL discover the same patterns more efficiently?
- How to make attacks more stealthy?
