# Paper Analysis Workflow

## Target Paper
$ARGUMENTS

## Analysis Mission
Execute a comprehensive, autonomous analysis of the specified research paper for the jailbreak RL project. This workflow should run end-to-end without user intervention, following the established research methodology.

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Paper Acquisition
- If given arXiv ID (e.g., 2310.06987): Use `mcp__arxiv-mcp-server__download_paper` to download and convert
- If given local PDF path: Note that direct PDF reading fails - extract arXiv ID if possible and use MCP
- If given research topic: Search for relevant papers using `mcp__arxiv-mcp-server__search_papers`

### Step 2: Context Discovery
- Use `mcp__arxiv-mcp-server__search_papers` to get paper metadata
- Extract: title, authors, abstract, categories, publication date, relevance to adversarial ML

### Step 3: Content Analysis
- Use `mcp__arxiv-mcp-server__read_paper` to get full paper content in markdown
- Wait for PDF‚Üímarkdown conversion to complete if needed
- Extract technical details, methodologies, experimental setup, results

### Step 4: Structured Analysis Output
Generate comprehensive analysis with these sections:

#### üîë Executive Summary
- 2-3 sentence TLDR of the paper's contribution

## Quality Assurance
- Verify paper relevance to jailbreak/adversarial ML research
- Cross-reference with existing project knowledge
- Provide confidence scores for key claims where appropriate
- Flag any contradictions with previous findings
- Suggest follow-up papers for deeper investigation

## Output Format
- Use clear markdown section headers
- Include bullet points for key insights
- Add code snippets where relevant
- Provide actionable next steps
- Structure for maximum research utility

## Execution Notes
- Run autonomously without user intervention
- Handle arXiv MCP conversion delays gracefully
- Provide progress updates for long-running conversions
- Generate consistent, structured output every time
- Focus on practical applications to jailbreak RL research
